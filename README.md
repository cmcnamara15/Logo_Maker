# Logo_Maker

## Description
This Project was built using nodejs, inquirer and jest. The goal of this project was to build a command line application that generates a SVG/logo. Using Inquirer this application prompts the user for four pieces information; text, text-color, shape, and shape-color. Once the user makes their choices a file is output in an example folder called logo.svg.
